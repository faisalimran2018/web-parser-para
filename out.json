      "On Thursday, Pakistan inked the final deal with Barrick and Antofagasta PLC representatives in London to revive the Reko Diq mining project and settle a long-running $11 billion dispute. The development came after the government received a \u2018favourable opinion' from the Supreme Court on the settlement agreement and required legislation was passed into law.",
      "Following the agreement, Reko Diq will be owned 50% by Barrick; 25% by three state-owned enterprises \u2014 the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGCDL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Private Limited (GHPL); 15% by Balochistan on a fully-funded basis and 10% by the province on a free-carried basis.",
      "In a statement, Barrick president and chief executive Mark Bristow said completion of the legal processes was key for the development of Reko Diq into \"a world-class, long-life mine\" which would substantially expand the company\u2019s copper portfolio and \"benefit its Pakistani stakeholders for generations to come\".",
      "Bristow said that Reko Diq would not contribute to Pakistan\u2019s economy, but also have a transformative impact on the underdeveloped Balochistan province, with 7,500 jobs expected to be created during peak construction and around 4,000 long-term jobs once it reaches the production phase.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re making sure that Balochistan and its people will see these benefits quickly. Starting early next year, Barrick will implement a range of social development programs prioritizing the improvement of healthcare, education, vocational training, food security and the provision of potable water. Our investment in these is expected to amount to around $70 million over the feasibility and construction period,\" he said.",

      "As I sign off for another year to take some well-deserved (if I do say so myself!) time away from the rigours of work with my family, I wanted to say thank you once more to all of Safetec's clients, our brilliant subcontractors, my fabulous staff team and all of the people who were willing to listen to me wax lyrical about Safetec and what we are able to offer you or your company! A massive thanks also to those who have motivated me to persist and drive myself and my team to achieve what we have achieved this year.",
      "Furthermore, with some major project wins on the horizon, we are always looking to add to our ever growing team. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are looking for a new challenge at a dynamic company with a strong client base and a host of diverse, ongoing projects.",
      "Finally, thank you to our colleagues at Safetec Nordic and Safetec Sweden AB who have been instrumental in the past year in providing support to many of the projects conducted by Safetec in the UK. Collaboration is key and I am encouraged by how well all component parts of the Safetec group have worked together on cross-country projects.",
      "Nothing more to say besides I hope that you all have a wonderful Christmas and a brilliant 2023! All the best to you and yours :-)",

      "I recently had the pleasure of interviewing Mr. Greg Goff, an experienced oil and gas executive. Mr. Goff was President and Chief Executive Officer of Andeavor (an integrated downstream energy company) from 2010 to 2018 and Chairman from December 2014 to 2018. In 2018 he was named by the Harvard Business Review as one of  the top performing CEOs in the world. Mr. Goff is currently a board director at ExxonMobil and you may recall his name as one of the directors on the slate of the Engine No. 1  campaign.
